Anders notes

white background for anything with text, texture is lovely but can cause legibility issues

look at padding/spacing around vertical and horizontal lines


use a maximum pages width for layout to stop sid from ice age eyes style layout. 

consider renaming View Items, possible with no title? or put additional actions? archive?

show stores on account page

adda cancel button to payment method new page

two types of whitespace can look busy, consider reducing or minimising one of them, look at other websites e.g. pizza hut

when overflowing look to fill from the left, it's more like reading a book than a menu.

consider a new menu design at breakpoints, it shows better consideration for specific types of user

choose a store as the first thing you do, force user to choose a store early.

if you don't have a store chosen, make any drink clicked redirect to pick a store (maybe with drink remembered)

tell the user that the coffee is added

consider using turbo to show existing order on the page

buttons with ampersands are confusing especially if they seem unrelated e.g. view & customize

red does not mean selected! pick a positive primary colour use a tick to show which option is select

BUG! if i go to checkout my basket gets cleared so adding a new order item to it then raises an error

look at how basket can be perennial, do we need customers to have multiple? Can we have open orders?

make it so you can add to a basket.

opening checkout should be non-destructive.

only clear basket when paid.

'you have not yet check in'

white background on textured background looks weird, consider a border?

skeumorphism or flat design, pick one! also dial back the drop shadows 

avoid sitting rounded corners next to straight edges

add search on store if more than 5 stores?

look at a switch for the menu for alternative layout.
